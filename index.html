    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Mediocre golf player and car racer. I get along with people who have taste.</p>
    <p>Taught myself design and code (a little). Got a job on the other side of the world. Moved. Spent three years witnessing one of the craziest periods of hypergrowth in tech. Then Covid hit. Co-founded a company, it was a lot of fun. Moved again — to London. Now I help early-stage companies (mostly with funding and connecting good friends from the industry). Also collect Porsches.</p>
